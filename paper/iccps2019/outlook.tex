%
In this paper, we have presented a new methodology and the tool-chain \toolreaffirm that effectively assist a designer to repair CPS models under unanticipated attacks automatically. 
%
The model transformation tool takes a resiliency pattern specified in the transformation language HATL and generates a new model including unknown parameters whose values can be determined by the synthesizer tool such that the safety requirement is satisfied.
%
We demonstrated the high-applicability of \toolreaffirm by using the tool-chain to efficiently repair CPS models under realistic attacks including the ACC models under the GPS sensor spoofing attack and the SMIB models under the sliding-model attack.

%\paragraph*{Future Work} %There are several directions for the future work of HyperSTL. 
%We first plan to introduce a library of HyperSTL fomulae that encapsulates different general classes of hyperproperties of CPS including those presented in this paper.
%%
%Second, the falsification algorithm of HyperSTL proposed in the paper is incomplete as it relies on self-composition (i.e. making copies of a system) and only falsifies a restricted class of hyperproperties. 
%%
%Thus, extending the falsification algorithm to bypass self-composition to falsify more interesting hyperproperties is planned. Also, the monitoring algorithms of HyperLTL recently proposed in~\cite{brett2017rewriting, agrawal2016runtime} could be applied to HyperSTL.
%%
%%On the other hand, we will also leverage the testing framework of HyperSTL to falsify a hyperproperty with finite-simulation guarantees.% and evaluate the performance of a bug-finding technique using industrial Simulink models.
%
%
%%In future work, we will improve a monitoring algorithm for HyperSTL and apply it to find falsifying traces for hyperproperties of industrial Simulink models.
